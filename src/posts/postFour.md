# Meeting with Netizen - 1/15/26
*by Martin Ratchford*
## Overview

The team met with Netizen and Dr. Wang in a Microsoft Teams meeting at 11am on January 15th, 2026. We talked about the roadmap for this semester. Asher asked about Wazuh and if there would be any problems that we may run into while integrating it. Apollo responded with the fact that there could be duplicated code in an XML file on Linux and Mac OS. \
\
Here is the first month of the roadmap for this project:

## Week 1
**Return from break:** \
We need to re-familiarize ourselves with the project so that we understand it again. \
Make sure that we add any new ideas to the board so that they are not missed and we can update them bit by bit. 

## Week 2
**Lab Expansions:** \
Over break a network card was acquired for the pfSense router. We need to install it. \
Ensure that the Vista PC is on and accessible at least through RDP, but not the internet. \
Possibly document these if they're big enough to post about.
\
**First Game Integration** \
The first cybersecurity concept will be implemented into the game.

## Week 3

**Wuzah Server** \
We need to get another computer out of the pile that we have waiting and install a Linux distribution of choice to be our Wuzah server so that we can centralize our log reporting. \
We need to write documentation in the blog/wiki about how to set up the Wuzah server. \
\
**Game Storyline Updates:** \
75% of the game story events will be written and added. \
A method of tracking individual event completion will be added to save data.

## Week 4

**Wuzah Clients** \
We also need to get all client computers to successfully sync to the server, which makes said server actually useful. \
Write a short blog post about what went in to making this happen, or integrate into the previous post. \
\
**Initial TSS Deployment** \
Attempt to run the game on all client computers to see how it interacts with Wazuh (if at all), and if there are any issues on specific machines.
