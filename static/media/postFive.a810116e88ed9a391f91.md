*by Martin Ratchford*

## Overview

Our team met with Netizen for a very breif meeting. We discussed the progress of the project and what the next steps are. We established that right after the meeting the team would begin getting the Wazuh server set up. We were made aware that it would take about an hour for downloading and installing everything that we would need. 

## Post-Meeting

After the meeting, the team began the installation of the Wazuh server. We also continued to work on story elements and the ablitiy for the player to get items in the Silver Slayer game.
